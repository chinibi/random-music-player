# Random Music Player

This is my first try at making a desktop app using Electron.  It's a music
player that plays sounds in a selected directory in a random order.

## Running the dev version

You need Git and Node.js installed to run this.  Have at least two terminal
windows open and run these commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chinibi/random-music-player.git
$ cd random-music-player
$ npm install
```

In one window run:

`$ npm run dev`

In the other window run:

`$ npm run start`
