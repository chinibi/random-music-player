# Random Music Player

This is my first try at making a desktop app using Electron.  It's a music
player that plays sounds in a selected directory in a random order.

## Running the dev version

You need Git and Node.js installed to run this.  From your command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chinibi/random-music-player.git
$ cd random-music-player
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
$ npm run start
```
